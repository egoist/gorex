# GoRex

A replica of [Superlogical's Rex](https://www.superlogical.com/updates/public-testing-beginning)
terminal, written in Go with [MyGo](https://mygo.egoist.dev)'s native UI and its
terminal plugin (Ghostty's libghostty-vt). No webview, no cgo: one ~15 MB app.

## What it does

- **Tabs and split panes.** Every pane is a card over the window's gradient,
  with its program's icon, name and directory in its header, and buttons to
  split right, split down, zoom and close. Drag the gaps between panes to
  resize them (double-click resets a split to half).
- **Persistent sessions.** Shells run in a session server, a background
  process of the same binary (`GoRex -server`). Quit GoRex and everything
  keeps running; open it again and every tab, split and pane comes back as
  it was, programs still running. The server keeps each session's screen in
  a headless libghostty-vt emulator and sends a snapshot on attach, so
  full-screen programs (lazygit, vim, htop…) come back exactly.
- **Program activity.** The server watches each terminal's foreground
  process (`tcgetpgrp`, `sysctl`, `proc_pidinfo`): headers and tabs name the
  program (`Node`, `Git Changes` for lazygit, `Codex`, `SSH host`…) and its
  working directory, a green dot shows a program printing, and an orange dot
  marks a pane whose program finished or rang the bell out of sight. When
  the window is in the background, a long command finishing posts a
  notification.
- **Tab icons** stack the tiles of a tab's programs, the focused pane's in
  front, as Rex does. Tabs reorder by dragging, rename by double-click, and
  have a context menu.
- **Host chip** with the machine's name and model; its popover shows the
  chip, memory, OS and the session server.
- **Command palette** (⇧⌘P, or the ⌘ button): every command, and every pane
  to jump to, fuzzy-matched.
- Light and dark appearances (View ▸ Appearance), text size (⌘+ ⌘− ⌘0),
  JetBrains Mono embedded.

## Develop and build

GoRex needs [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) 1.27+ and MyGo 0.3.0, whose CLI
`go.mod` pins as a tool:

```sh
go tool mygo dev     # GoRex Dev, rebuilt and restarted as the code changes
go test ./...        # the server, and the view without a window
go tool mygo build   # build/darwin-arm64/GoRex.app and a .dmg
go run ./tools/mkicon  # redraw resources/icon.png
```

`go get -tool github.com/egoist/mygo/cmd/mygo@latest` updates MyGo and its
CLI together.

The app keeps its state in its data directory: the server's socket and
log, `layout.json` and `settings.json`, in `~/Library/Application
Support/GoRex` for the built app and `GoRex Dev` for `mygo dev`'s, so
that developing never touches the sessions of the app you use
(`GOREX_DIR` names another directory). The sessions outlive the app, but
not a rebuild: a development build replaces a server that an older build
started, ending its sessions, which then start again in the same
directories.

## Layout

| | |
|---|---|
| `main.go` | the app, its window, and `-server` |
| `state.go` | tabs, the tree of splits, panes, saving and restoring the layout |
| `view.go`, `tabs.go`, `host.go`, `commands.go` | the interface: title bar, tabs, panes, host popover, menus and palette |
| `programs.go` | how programs show: names, glyphs, tile colors |
| `style.go`, `settings.go` | colors, fonts, terminal themes; appearance and text size |
| `internal/rex` | the session server and its client: PTYs, foreground processes, headless screens, the socket protocol |

Not replicated: Rex's connections to servers on other machines; GoRex's
server listens on a local socket only.
